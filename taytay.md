Well done Inspector Meepah! It's time for your final puzzle!

The doors to Seabright Manor open with a slow groan. The lobby is dimly lit, cold, with thick rugs on the floor and shelves caked with dust. On a whim, you push open the ornate door on the right and enter the game room. Several large men are milling around and a few more are sitting in deep antique sofas by the fire. Six faces in all turn to look at you, sizing you up.

“Miss, I’m sorry, miss”, one man peels away from a conversation and approaches you. “You can’t be in here, there’s been a murder.”

“A murder?”

“Yes, ma’am. A murder. The owner of this manor, Sir Hartly von Bartly, was killed last night. For your own safety, it’s best if you leave at once before the police arrive.” The man looks out the window worringly. 

“Sir Hartly is dead? But he was the man I came here to see! I heard he was the biggest lumby in all of Bigsurlafershire”, you say.

“Ah yes, his mustache was renowned throughout the region. And I, Stapes, his trusted butler, loved him like a brother. But you see, the circumstances around his death are rather... supernatural. There are legends of werewolves in these hills, and last night, well, last night was a full moon...”

The men are all up now, facing Stapes. The fire crackles in the corner, sending dancing shadows throughout the decrepit room.

"A werewolf killed him?!", you exclaim. "Oh my, how dreadfully disturbing. And his body? Was he torn to pieces?"

Now one of the men chimes in.

"Just a blow to the head, ma'am. But a frightfully powerful one at that", remarks Craigle.

"A blow to the head, huh", you respond. After a moment's consideration, you continue. "And what was everyone here up to last night?"

“Last night, hmm”, starts Boxtodd. “I was in the observatory until very late watching the lunar occultation of Venus. But I had a hard time focusing as I kept hearing music from somewhere.”

"That would have been me", offers Boadtoy. "I was in the piano room practicing Clair de Lune. At some point I thought I heard a scream, but perhaps it was just the wind.”

"No, I heard it too!", exclaims Ranedear. “I was in the parlor reading up on the history of the manor. When I had reached the year 1841, I heard someone cry out! But I couldn't hear any music, perhaps our rooms were too far apart for that.”

You run a finger though the dust built up on windowsill and start pacing around the room. Six pairs of eyes follow you. You pass faded oil paintings, rusty antiques, marbles, toys, jars of old coins, all dull and still. Pool cues mounted on the wall. A worn trophy in need of a good polishing.

"I also did not hear the scream", says Stapes. "I was playing poker with Craigle in the greenhouse. When we split up, the music was still playing, and I continued up to my room for a drink and rest."

"After poker, I went to the kitchen for a snack", provides Craigle. "Maybe I heard a scream, maybe I didn't. I was focused on my mortadella and mustard sandwich."

You pass deer heads, chess boards, a heavy camera, all caked in dust. The attention of the room has moved to Vanlos, the last man to speak.

"I didn't see or hear anything", begins Vanlos. "I was on a night swim in Elephant Seal Cove under the full moon. I got back late and went straight to bed."

You continue your slow lap around the room and reach the far end where a long unused fireman's axe leans against the brick. You pick it up and swing it a few times, testing its heft. After replacing it, you circle around to the pool table, toss one of the balls up and down a few times, and address the crowd.

“Well, it's clear no one here had anything to do with it. None of you killed that beautiful, mustachioed, bull of a man.”

You turn away to the wall and run your eyes up the shelf. In the gleaming surface of the heavy goblet sitting at the top, you can see the reflections of each man in the room, their eyes on your back. Boadtoy looks nervous. Boxtodd and Vanlos are unreadable. Craigle is composed. Ranedear has his head in his hands, and Stapes stands ominously by the window. You see your own reflection in the polished silver, the freckles and ginger curls, but above all the determination in your gaze. There’s a lumby killer in this room, and you’ve seen enough.

“Gentleman, I supposed it’s time for my introduction”, you begin. “I am Inspector S. J. Meepah. I solved the Caper of CDMX and the Mystery of Mont Blanc. I recovered the Lost Jewel of Danger Mountain. I journeyed to the Sweltering Snaeb and rode the Lascivious Llama. To me, this case is already closed. Not only do I know who the killer is, I can identify the murder weapon in this very room! The killer is … ACHOO.”

Your dust allergy has gotten the better of you again, and in your moment of hesitation, one man bolts from the room. He makes it as far as the main courtyard before the police, who had just pulled up outside, see him fleeing the scene and tackle him to the ground. Justice has been served for the ghost of Sir Hartly von Bartly, and once again Inspector Meepah cracks the case.

Who was the killer? What was the murder weapon? To submit your answer, write the name and the weapon as one word. So if you think it was Stapes with a pool cue, try “stapespoolcue”.
