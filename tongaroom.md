Wow, so talented! Are you sure you're not getting any help? Well, you made it this far. This one may be a bit trickier! Good luck!

Walking down the busy street, many smells all call to me,

Aromas sweet of pastries neat, flaky and so buttery.

Yearning for the perfect bite, from croissants to kouign amanns,

Freshly baked delights in sight, but where am I? The name is gone,

A scone that shatter into crumbs, cookies with a fudgy core,

Really now my mind is numb, could this be some acrostic lore?

Everything a dream come true, but still Iâ€™m caught in memory,

Reaching, grasping, searching now, what is this fragrant bakery?
