Wow, so talented! Are you sure you're not getting any help? Well, you made it this far. This one may be a bit trickier! Good luck!

Walking down the busy street, many smells all call to me,

Aromas sweet of pastries neat, flaky and so buttery.

Yearning for the perfect bite, from croissants to kouign amanns,

Freshly baked delights in sight, but where am I? The name is gone,

A scone that shatters into crumbs and cookies with a fudgy core,

Really now my mind is numb, there simply must be deeper lore

Everything a dream come true, but still Iâ€™m caught in memory,

Reaching, grasping, searching now, is this Acrostic Bakery?
