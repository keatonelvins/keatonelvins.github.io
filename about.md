> “How well I could write if I were not here! If between the white page and the writing of words and stories that take shape and disappear without anyone's ever writing them there were not interposed that uncomfortable partition which is my person!”

> <author>Italo Calvino</author>

goals:
- write more, learn more
- be funky, fresh (not banal, tedious, lame)
- avoid posturing
