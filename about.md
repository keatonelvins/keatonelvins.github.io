I love to [read](/reads), [take photos](https://www.keat.one), and find flow states.

I'm a big believer in learning through teaching. Poke around on here for my thoughts on some interesting papers, notes for what I'm working on, or anything else that came to mind.

Here are some problems occupying my brain space:

* Agentic Behavior: How do we build agents that can learn and improve from their environment? What mental models do we need for multi-agent orchestration?
* Reasoning: What factors play a role in eliciting reasoning abilities in language models? How can we gain concrete insight on the computation taking place?
* Mechanistic Interpretability: What can we learn about emergent properties & conceptual gaps under this lens? What happens internally when models learn from execution feedback?
