Hi! I'm a Master's student at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences interested in AI alignment and emergent behaviors of language models. Here are some directions I'm excited about:

* Reasoning: What are the factors that lead to the emergence of reasoning abilities in LLM's? Are they even capable of "true" reasoning at all? How can we gain concrete insight on their internal processes?
* Generalization: How can we develop robust systems that generalize well? What is the importance of training data in this problem space? How does our intuition hold up in the interpolation/saturation regimes?
* Human-AI collaboration: How can we validate intelligent systems are able to infer user's intent? What happens when models learn from human feedback?
  
I'm a big believer in learning through teaching. Please check out my posts where I'll give thoughts on interesting papers, jot down notes for whatever I'm working on, or upload anything else that comes to mind.

In my free time, I love to read and take photos. I'm also very interested in music and plan to do more side projects with the Spotify Web API. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk!

I did all the styling and design work for this website myself using Jekyll!
