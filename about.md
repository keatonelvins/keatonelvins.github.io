Hi! I'm a Master's student at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences focused on AI safety and model interpretability. Here are some problem spaces I'm interested in:

* Mechanistic Interpretability: What can we learn about emergent properties & conceptual gaps under this lens? What happens internally when models learn from human feedback?
* Reasoning: What factors play a role in eliciting reasoning abilities in language models? How can we gain concrete insight on the computation taking place?
* Generalization: Can models tell when they are working out-of-domain? How is their uncertainty expressed?

I'm a big believer in learning through teaching. Poke around on here for my thoughts on some interesting papers, notes for whatever I'm working on, or anything else that came to mind.

In my free time, I love to read and [take photos](https://www.keat.one). I'm also very interested in music and plan to do more side projects as part of the Spotify developer community. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat!
