In 2023, I graduated in EECS from UC Berkeley.

In 2024, I co-founded [camfer](https://camfer.dev) 

(see the similarity?!).

I love to [read](/reads) and [take photos](https://www.keat.one).

Outside of work, I'm mostly just interested in how the brain works. 

If you know, please tell me! (I'm desperate)
