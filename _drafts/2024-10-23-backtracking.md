I've recently had to make a significant amount of potentially life-altering personal decisions (three!). Consequential ones. Maybe not quite earth-shattering, but still decisions that had me taking long night walks and outsourcing mental load to friends/family and stewing endlessly.

Now, in my post-decision era, many of these same friends/family have asked "Do you think you made the right choice?".

This is an admittedly standard question. And clearly coming from a good place. But it comes loaded with a somewhat complex presupposition that has really been bothering me, and it took some additional stewing to really pin it down.

Do I think I made the **right** choice?

Baked in is the assumption there is an empirically _correct_ branch on this binary tree. A branch that is identifiably true after getting up above the whole mess and looking back down on it.

Holy fallacious!!!

Imagine running DFS until you reach the first leaf node and then trying to provide anything useful about the graph as a whole.

"There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison. We live everything as it comes, without warning, like an actor going on cold. And what can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life itself? That is why life is always like a sketch. No, 'sketch' is not quite the word, because a sketch is an outline of something, the groundwork for a picture, whereas the sketch that is our life is a sketch for nothing, an outline with no picture." - Milan Kundera
