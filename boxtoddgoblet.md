YOU DID IT YESSSSSS. The caper completed:

Stapes turns to you, amazement on his face. "But how did you know it was Boxtodd? And with the goblet?"

"Simple", you respond. "He said he was watching the lunar occultation of Venus. So he was watching Venus disappear behind the moon. And last night the moon was full, which means it was on the side of Earth opposite the Sun. But Venus is always on the side towards the Sun. So how could the Moon block us from seeing Venus when they're on opposite sides? It's impossible! Then I saw the goblet. Every inch of this room is caked in dust except for that goblet, which happens to be so recently rubbed down I could see my reflection in it? To tell you the truth, I'm still not sure how exactly he did it. I imagine he hid in the room early on, waited for Hartly to lock the door and open the skylight, then struck him down, scaled the chain to the skylight, and escaped. But that's just speculation, I'm sure his confession will be much more revealing."

Bravo Inspector Meepah, you did again. And that was way harder than Pah's! Hope you had fun, happy birthday meep meep.
