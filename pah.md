Hello Pah! For your surprise, you will have to solve a series of riddles. 
The url for this page is www.keatonelvins.github.io/pah.
When you think you have solved the riddle, replace the filepath (in this case "pah") in the url with the solution.
If you get a 404, keep trying! Here is the first riddle:

Where the golden fog alights,

By a bridge in morning light,

I stand tall with ancient pride,

Captive, cloistered, I reside.

Once I roamed open lands,

Now in silicon, I stand.

A tasty snack as some would say,

Grazing 'till the end of days.

What am I?
