If you actually understand something, you should be able to build it from scratch. Came across [Stanford cs336](https://stanford-cs336.github.io/spring2025/) recently and it inspired me to start this long journey. 

Going to build the whole training stack bottom up! There are plenty of very deep write-ups out there, so I'm mainly just going to document which personal abstractions break along the way.
