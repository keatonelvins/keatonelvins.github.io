A lot of my recent work on language modeling has been at a very high level of abstraction. So many frameworks, wrappers, libraries!! Have been wanting to get more in the weeds in my free time and came across [Stanford cs336](https://stanford-cs336.github.io/spring2025/). So so cool what they're doing!

Going to keep this as a running post as I work through the assignments with any new lessons/things I learned.
